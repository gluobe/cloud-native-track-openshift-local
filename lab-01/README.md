# Lab 01 - Creating an app from a Docker image

In this lab you will learn how to create a new project on OpenShift and how to
create an application from an existing docker image.

## Task 1: Create a new project from command line

The command below creates a new project and is setting a description and display
name for the project.

```
oc new-project lab-01 --description="lab-01" --display-name="lab-01"

---

Now using project "lab-01" on server "https://api.crc.testing:6443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app rails-postgresql-example

to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.33 -- /agnhost serve-hostname

```

Upon project creation, OpenShift will automatically switch to the newly created
project/namespace. If you wish to view the list of projects, run the following
command:

```
oc get projects

---

NAME     DISPLAY NAME   STATUS
lab-01   lab-01         Active
```

If you have more than one project, you can switch to a different one by issuing
`oc project <project name>`. Although you donâ€™t want to do it now.

You can also check the status of the project by running the following command.
It says that the project is currently not running anything.

```
oc status

In project lab-01 on server https://api.crc.testing:6443

You have no services, deployment configs, or build configs.
Run 'oc new-app' to create an application.
```

## Task 2: Create an app from a Docker image

Next we will create an application inside the above project using an existing
docker image. We will be using a very simple Docker image from Docker Hub that
just says 'Welcome to OpenShift V3. Let us just use that for this exercise.

First create a new application using the docker image using the `oc new-app`
command as shown below:

```
oc new-app gluobe/welcome-php --name=welcome

---

--> Found container image 616b725 (5 years old) from Docker Hub for "gluobe/welcome-php"

    chx/welcome-php-1:b68a2d86 
    -------------------------- 
    Platform for building and running PHP 5.6 applications

    Tags: builder, php, php56, rh-php56

    * An image stream tag will be created as "welcome:latest" that will track this image

--> Creating resources ...
    imagestream.image.openshift.io "welcome" created
    deployment.apps "welcome" created
    service "welcome" created
--> Success
    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
     'oc expose service/welcome' 
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
```

The above command uses the docker image to deploy a docker container in a pod.
If you quickly run `oc get pods` you will notice that a deployer pod runs and it
starts an application pod as shown below.

```
oc get pods

---

NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
welcome-1-deploy   1/1       Running   0          1m
welcome-1-dkyyq    0/1       Pending   0          0s
```

In the above example `welcome-1-deploy` is the deployer pod and the other one is
the actual application pod. In a little while the deployer pod will succeed and
the application pod will change for `Pending` to `Running` status.

```
oc get pods

---

NAME              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
welcome-1-dkyyq   1/1       Running   0          56s
```

## Task 3: Add a route for your app

OpenShift also spins up a service for this application. Run the following
command to view the list of services in the project (you can also use
`oc get svc` shorthand).

```
oc get services

---

NAME      CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
welcome   172.30.77.93   <none>        8080/TCP   2m
```

You will notice the `welcome` service was created for this project.

However, there is no route for this application yet. So you cannot access this
application from outside.

Now add a route to the service with the following command. `oc expose` command
will allow you to expose your service to the world so that you can access it
from the browser.

```
oc expose service welcome --name=welcome

---

route.route.openshift.io/welcome exposed
```

With the `oc get routes` commad very that the route has been created:

```
oc get routes

---

NAME      HOST/PORT                         PATH   SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
welcome   welcome-lab-01.apps-crc.testing          welcome    8080-tcp                 None
```

## Task 4: Test your app

From the `oc get routes` copy the host and surf to it from your browser:
http://welcome-lab-01.apps-crc.testing

Voila!! you have created your first application using an existing docker image on
OpenShift.

## Task 5: Clean up

Run the `oc get all` command to view all the components that were created in
your project.

```
oc get all

---

NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/welcome-d5bc57c78-nm7jg   1/1     Running   0          58s

NAME              TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
service/welcome   ClusterIP   10.217.4.196   <none>        8080/TCP   59s

NAME                      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/welcome   1/1     1            1           59s

NAME                                 DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/welcome-79c84d8cb7   0         0         0       59s
replicaset.apps/welcome-d5bc57c78    1         1         1       58s

NAME                                     IMAGE REPOSITORY                                                         TAGS     UPDATED
imagestream.image.openshift.io/welcome   default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps-crc.testing/lab-01/welcome   latest   58 seconds ago

NAME                               HOST/PORT                         PATH   SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
route.route.openshift.io/welcome   welcome-lab-01.apps-crc.testing          welcome    8080-tcp                 None
```

Now you can delete all these components by running one command.

```
oc delete all --all

pod "welcome-1-8gwxj" deleted
replicationcontroller "welcome-1" deleted
service "welcome" deleted
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io "welcome" deleted
imagestream.image.openshift.io "welcome" deleted
route.route.openshift.io "welcome" deleted
```

You will notice that it has deleted the imagestream for the application, the
deploymentconfig, the service and the route.

You can run `oc get all` again to make sure the project is empty.

```
oc get all

---

No resources found.
```

Congratulations!! You now know how to create a project, an application using an
external docker image and navigate around. Get ready for more fun stuff!

Delete the project with the following command.

```
oc delete project lab-01

---

project.project.openshift.io "lab-01" deleted
```
